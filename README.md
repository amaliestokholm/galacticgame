# Game: Galactic Archaeology

This is a small game, showcasing the key idea behind the research of Galactic Archaeology.

The idea with the game is for the user to learn the connection between `colour`, `movement` and `sound` in a toy model of a simple galaxy. The user can make observations, game-mechanic-wise by clicking on a star, and then note down what they find in a drag-and-drop note block.
The user wins when the note block is filled out correctly.

There will be a follow-up piece of explanation on Galactic Archaeology soon.

This is also a way for me to improve my js and css skills -- this is  not perfect, but it does exist.
